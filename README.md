# College-Management-Sysytem

The College Management System is a comprehensive platform featuring five interconnected sections: Student, Teacher, Alumni, Library, and Hostel. Each section offers password-protected access via an elegantly designed terminal-based user interface. Students can manage courses, grades, and schedules, while teachers can input grades, manage classes, and communicate with students. Alumni can access resources and stay connected with the institution. The Library section facilitates book borrowing, returns, and catalog searches. Hostel management includes room allocation and maintenance requests. This system streamlines administrative tasks, enhances communication, and provides a user-friendly experience for all stakeholders.
